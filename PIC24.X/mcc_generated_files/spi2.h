  @Summary
    This is the generated header file for the SPI2 driver using MPLAB® Code Configurator

  @Description
    This header file provides APIs for driver for SPI2.
    Generation Information :
        Product Revision  :  MPLAB® Code Configurator - v2.25.2
        Device            :  PIC24FJ64GA006
        Driver Version    :  0.5
    The generated drivers are tested against the following:
        Compiler          :  XC16 v1.24
        MPLAB 	          :  MPLAB X v2.35 or v3.00
